Follow carefully these instructions:

1) Read CLAUDE.MD to understand how things should be done and the core features that should be implemented
2) Analyse how the current version of the code works
2) For each task needed to bring the code up to the requirements in README.MD, create a GitHub issue via the `gh` CLI, making sure that the issue is tagged with `claude-code`
